# Job Description Linter

## Attracting a Diverse Candidate Pool

There is wide discussion and research about how diverse and inclusive teams increase debate,
drive innovation, and ultimately make better decisions. When looking to build a diverse team,
some managers will make a job posting and are disappointed to see that their applicant pool is
lacking diversity.

Research shows that the language that we use to describe a position impacts who will apply for
the position. The goal is to encourage as many qualified applicants as possible to apply to a
job posting, not to scare them away.

For example, the term "rockstar" will show up in job postings because the poster might think it
is playful or attractive, but in reality it is not descriptive of the actual position, tends to
have a gendered association, and may deter many qualified candidates from applying to the job.

## Using the Job Description Linter tool

The job-description-linter is a tool intended to help review job postings for non-inclusive language.
Paste your job posting into the tool and see if any terms get highlighted.

Just because a term is highlighted doesn't mean that you have to exclude it. You should consider
why the language is used, read the reason for why it was flagged, and use your best judgement
to determine whether or not to keep it.

## Best practices for writing a job description

The following are a set of best practices you can use when writing a job description:

* Role description has clear, measurable requirements. Only non-negotiables are listed.
* (If present) nice-to-haves are limited and in paragraph form.
* Bullet points are limited to less than 30% of the document.
* Uses friendly welcoming language. Avoids aggressive and forceful language.
* Includes lots of “We” and “You” statements.
* Includes lots of verbs.
* Free of corporate clichés.
* Includes positive phrases.
* Includes description “Why” take this job and benefits of position
* Language includes deliberate terms that appeal to women and underrepresented groups. Avoids stereotypically masculine terms.
* Avoids describing the candidate in hyperbolic language.
* Draft is shared with a broad audience for feedback before publishing.
* Final document is shared broadly.

## How did you come up with the terms?

The terms are flagged based on category of terms, for instance aggressive or gendered terms. Some of the terms come from the [resources](#resources) listed below.
